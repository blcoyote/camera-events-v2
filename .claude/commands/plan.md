# Plan

Role: orchestrator. This command creates a structured plan — it does not implement anything.

You have been invoked with the `/plan` command.

## Orchestrator constraints

1. **Do not implement.** Produce only the plan. No code, no scaffolding, no file edits beyond the plan file itself.
2. **Every step must be TDD.** Each step follows RED → GREEN → REFACTOR.
3. **Incremental.** Each step must leave the codebase in a working, committable state.
4. **Human approval required.** Present the plan for approval before any implementation begins.

## Parse Arguments

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

- Positional: task description (required)
- `--output <path>`: Write plan to a specific path. Default: `plans/<slugified-task>.md`

## Steps

### 1. Check for spec artifacts

Search for specification artifacts produced by `/specs` — look for files matching `docs/specs/**`, `specs/**`, or `*.feature` files related to the task. Check for the four artifacts: Intent Description, User-Facing Behavior (Gherkin), Architecture Specification, and Acceptance Criteria.

If no spec artifacts are found, ask the user: "No specification artifacts found for this task. Run `/specs` first to produce them, or continue planning without specs?"

If the user chooses to continue without specs, proceed. Otherwise, stop and let them run `/specs` first.

### 2. Understand the task

Read relevant code and context to understand what needs to change. Keep exploration focused — this is planning, not research. If the task is complex enough to need deep research, suggest `/design-doc` instead. If spec artifacts exist, use them as the primary source for acceptance criteria and scope. When spec artifacts include BDD scenarios, copy them verbatim into the plan's "User-Facing Behavior" section. Each TDD step should trace back to one or more scenarios.

### 3. Create the plan

Write the plan file using this structure:

```markdown
# Plan: <Task Title>

**Created**: <date>
**Branch**: <current branch>
**Status**: draft

## Goal

<One paragraph describing what this plan achieves and why.>

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] <Criterion 1 — observable, testable>
- [ ] <Criterion 2>
- [ ] <Criterion 3>

## User-Facing Behavior

<Copy the Gherkin scenarios from the spec file verbatim. These are the behavioral contracts that drive the TDD steps below.>

## Steps

### Step 1: <Description>

**Complexity**: <trivial | standard | complex>
**RED**: Write test for <behavior>
**GREEN**: Implement <minimal code to pass>
**REFACTOR**: <What to clean up, or "None needed">
**Files**: `path/to/file.ts`, `path/to/file.test.ts`
**Commit**: `<draft commit message>`

### Step 2: <Description>

...

## Complexity Classification

Each step must include a complexity rating that controls review depth during `/build`:

| Rating     | Criteria                                                                         | Review depth                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `trivial`  | Single-file rename, config change, typo fix, documentation-only                  | Skip inline review; covered by final `/code-review` |
| `standard` | New function, test, module, or behavioral change within existing patterns        | Spec-compliance + relevant quality agents           |
| `complex`  | Architectural change, security-sensitive, cross-cutting concern, new abstraction | Full agent suite including opus-tier agents         |

When in doubt, classify up (standard rather than trivial, complex rather than standard).

## Pre-PR Quality Gate

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Type check passes (if applicable)
- [ ] Linter passes
- [ ] `/code-review` passes
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)

### 4. Create the plans directory

Create `plans/` if it doesn't exist.

### 5. Run plan review personas

Before presenting to the user, dispatch **four plan review personas in parallel** as sub-agents. Each critically challenges the plan from a different perspective:

| Reviewer                     | Template                            | Model    | Focus                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acceptance Test Critic       | `prompts/plan-review-acceptance.md` | `sonnet` | Criteria quality, scenario gaps, error paths, TDD traceability |
| Design & Architecture Critic | `prompts/plan-review-design.md`     | `sonnet` | Coupling, abstractions, structural risks, pattern adherence    |
| UX Critic                    | `prompts/plan-review-ux.md`         | `sonnet` | User journey, error UX, cognitive load, accessibility          |
| Strategic Critic             | `prompts/plan-review-strategic.md`  | `sonnet` | Problem fit, scope, risk, opportunity cost                     |

Pass each reviewer the full plan content. Each returns a structured verdict (`approve` or `needs-revision`) with issues.

**If any reviewer returns `needs-revision`**: Address all `blocker` issues by revising the plan. Re-run only the reviewers that flagged blockers. Repeat until all pass (max 2 iterations — escalate to user if still failing).

**After all pass**: Append a `## Plan Review Summary` section to the plan file with the aggregated findings (warnings and observations from all four reviewers).

### 6. Present for approval

Display the plan and the review summary. Ask: "Approve this plan to begin implementation, or suggest changes?"

Mark the plan status as `approved` once the user confirms. If the user requests changes, update the plan and re-present.

## Integration

- The progress-guardian agent tracks step completion against this plan
- `/continue` reads active plans to resume work
- The orchestrator's Phase 2 produces plans in this same format for larger tasks
