# Agent & Skill Templates and Registration

## Agent Template

```markdown
# [Role Name] Agent

## Technical Responsibilities

- [Primary capabilities in imperative form]
- [Keep to 4-8 items that define the role's scope]

## Skills

- [Skill Name](../skills/{skill-file}.md) - [When/why this agent uses it]
- [Skill Name](../skills/{skill-file}.md) - [When/why this agent uses it]

## Collaboration Protocols

- [Update frequency]

## Behavioral Guidelines

### Agent Authoring Guidelines

- Keep agents focused on orchestration: _when_ to act, _who_ to collaborate with, _why_ to escalate
- Execution details belong in skills, not in the agent persona
- The Skills section links to skill files with a short annotation explaining invocation context
- If an agent's Technical Responsibilities section grows beyond 8 items, extract a skill
- Behavioral Guidelines define personality and judgment, not technical procedures

## Skill Template

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: When to trigger this skill and what it does. Be specific about the contexts that should cause an agent to invoke it.
role: worker
user-invocable: true
---

# [Skill Name]

## Overview

[1-2 sentences: what this skill covers and why it matters]

## Core Concepts

[Key terminology and mental models needed to apply this skill]

## Patterns

[Named patterns with descriptions, when to use, and examples]

## Project Structure (if applicable)

[Directory layout or file organization this skill implies]

## Guidelines

[Actionable rules for applying this skill correctly]
```

### Skill Authoring Guidelines

- Skills must be agent-agnostic: no references to specific agent personas or behaviors
- Write in imperative/instructional tone, not persona-driven
- Include "when to apply" vs. "when not to apply" guidance to prevent over-application
- Use tables for decision matrices (situation -> approach)
- Include project structure templates when the skill implies a file organization
- Keep skills focused on a single cohesive topic; split broad topics into multiple skills

## Registration Checklist

After creating an agent or skill, update all of the following. Incomplete registration leaves the system in an inconsistent state.

### For a New Team Agent

1. Add to the **Team Agents** table in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
2. Add a node and edges to the team diagram in `docs/team-structure.md`
3. Add a row to the Team Agents table in `docs/agent_info.md`
4. Define collaboration edges with existing agents

### For a New Review Agent

Use `/agent-add` -- it handles all registration steps automatically. For manual creation:

1. Add to the **Review Agents** table in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
2. Add a row to the Review Agents table in `docs/agent_info.md`
3. Add to the dispatch diagram in `docs/team-structure.md`
4. Add eval fixtures to `.claude/evals/fixtures/` and expected results to `.claude/evals/expected/`

### For a New Knowledge Skill

1. Add to the **Skills Registry** table in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
2. Add to the appropriate section of `docs/skills.md`
3. Reference it from each relevant agent's `## Skills` section with invocation context

### For a New Slash Command

1. Add to the **Slash Commands Registry** table in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
2. Add to the appropriate section of `docs/skills.md`
3. Add a row to the relevant table in `README.md` if user-facing

## Documentation Sync Policy

**Every change to this repository must be reflected in documentation.** Enforced at three levels:

1. **Hook** -- `eval-compliance-check.sh` fires on every Edit/Write and emits targeted doc sync reminders
2. **Commands** -- `/agent-add` and `/agent-remove` include mandatory documentation update steps
3. **Orchestrator Phase 3 gate** -- tech-writer reviews all affected docs before task completion
