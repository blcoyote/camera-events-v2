description: Validate test suite quality by running a real mutation testing tool and triaging surviving mutants. Use after writing tests to verify assertions catch behavioral changes, when evaluating test coverage quality, or as a CI quality gate on critical modules. The AI value here is triage — classifying survivors, writing fix tests — not generating or estimating mutations.

# Mutation Testing

## Overview

Coverage tells you what code your tests execute. Mutation testing tells you if your tests would **detect changes** to that code. A test suite with high coverage but a low mutation score has weak assertions — it runs code without verifying behavior.

This skill wraps real mutation testing tools (Stryker, pitest) and adds AI-powered triage of surviving mutants. The tool does the deterministic work (mutate code, run tests, report survivors). The AI does the judgment work (classify survivors, explain gaps, write fix tests).

**This skill does NOT estimate or guess mutation outcomes.** If no mutation tool is available, it helps set one up. It does not substitute academic reasoning for actual test execution.

## Constraints

- **Always ask the user before running mutation testing.** Present the time estimate (see below) and scope, and get explicit approval. This applies during review workflows, build phases, and direct invocation. Mutation testing can be slow — never surprise the user with a long-running process.
- Only run after tests exist; mutation testing validates tests, it does not replace them
- Do not chase 100% mutation score; equivalent mutants are noise
- Scope to changed files by default; full-codebase runs are periodic audits
- Surviving mutants in critical paths require action; in trivial code they may be acceptable

## Time Estimation

Estimate duration using heuristics in `references/tool-setup.md`. Present the estimate to the user and get approval before running. If the estimate exceeds 5 minutes, suggest scoping down.

## Step 1: Detect or Set Up Tooling

Detect and install the appropriate mutation tool for the project's language (Stryker for JS/TS, pitest for Java/Kotlin, mutmut for Python, Stryker.NET for C#) -- see `references/tool-setup.md` for per-language detection and installation. **Do not proceed without a working tool.**

## Step 2: Run the Tool (Scoped to Target)

Run the mutation tool scoped to the user-specified files or changed files. See `references/tool-setup.md` for per-language command examples. Capture the full output and note any HTML report paths.

## Step 3: Parse Results

Extract surviving mutants from the tool output. Map each to:

| Field             | Source                                                         |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File + line       | Tool report                                                    |
| Mutation operator | Tool report (e.g., "ConditionalBoundary", "NegateConditional") |
| Original code     | Read the source at that line                                   |
| Mutated code      | Tool report or infer from operator                             |
| Mutation score    | Tool summary                                                   |

## Step 4: Triage Survivors (AI Value)

This is where AI adds value the tool cannot. For each surviving mutant, classify it:

### Classification

| Classification           | Meaning                                                             | Action                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Equivalent**           | Mutation produces identical behavior                                | Mark as excluded — no test can kill it   |
| **Missing assertion**    | A test executes this code but doesn't assert on the affected output | Strengthen the existing test's assertion |
| **Missing test case**    | No test exercises the mutated path                                  | Write a new test                         |
| **Undertested boundary** | Mutation exposes a boundary/edge case with no coverage              | Add a boundary test                      |
| **Acceptable risk**      | Trivial code where the mutation doesn't matter in practice          | Document and skip                        |

### Triage Procedure

For each survivor:

1. **Read the source context** — understand what the code does and why
2. **Check for equivalence** — does the mutation actually change observable behavior? Common equivalent patterns:
   - Mutating dead code or unreachable branches
   - Changing order of commutative operations
   - Negating conditions that are redundant with other guards
   - Mutating logging/debug-only code
3. **Find related tests** — which tests cover this code? What do they assert?
4. **Classify** — missing assertion, missing test, boundary gap, or equivalent?
5. **Write the fix test** — using RED-GREEN discipline: the test must fail against the mutant and pass against the original

### Weak vs Strong Test Patterns

The most common reason mutants survive: tests execute code without meaningfully asserting on behavior.

**Arithmetic operators** — Beware identity values:

```js
// WEAK: 0 is identity for addition — a + 0 === a - 0
expect(calculate(5, 0)).toBe(5) // passes with + or -

// STRONG: non-identity values distinguish operators
expect(calculate(5, 3)).toBe(8) // fails if + becomes -
```

**Conditional boundaries** — Test both sides:

```js
// WEAK: only tests the happy path
expect(isAdult(25)).toBe(true)

// STRONG: test the boundary
expect(isAdult(18)).toBe(true) // exactly at boundary
expect(isAdult(17)).toBe(false) // one below
```

**Return values** — Assert the actual return, not just truthiness:

```js
// WEAK: passes if return value changes from obj to true
expect(getUser(1)).toBeTruthy()

// STRONG: assert on the actual shape
expect(getUser(1)).toEqual({ id: 1, name: 'Alice' })
```

**Statement deletion** — Verify side effects:

```js
// WEAK: doesn't detect if save() call is removed
processOrder(order)

// STRONG: verify the side effect occurred
processOrder(order)
expect(db.save).toHaveBeenCalledWith(order)
```

## Step 5: Fix and Verify

After writing fix tests:

1. **Verify the fix test fails against the mutant** — if possible, manually apply the mutation and run the test to confirm it catches it. If the tool supports re-running specific mutants, use that.
2. **Re-run the mutation tool** on the same scope to confirm the mutant is now killed.
3. **Report the updated mutation score.**

## When to Apply

| Situation                                                        | Apply?                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Validating test suite quality after TDD                          | Yes                                      |
| Identifying weak assertions ("tests pass but I'm not confident") | Yes                                      |
| After writing tests for legacy code                              | Yes                                      |
| CI quality gate on critical modules                              | Yes                                      |
| Reviewing a PR with test changes                                 | Yes                                      |
| No tests exist yet                                               | No — write tests first                   |
| No mutation tool installed and user declines setup               | No — explain limitation, do not estimate |
| Prototype or spike code                                          | No                                       |

## Guidelines

1. **Always use a real mutation tool.** Do not estimate, guess, or academically reason about which mutants would survive. Run the tool, read the output.
2. Start with changed files. Full-codebase runs are expensive and noisy.
3. The AI's job is triage and fix-test authoring, not mutation generation. The tool handles generation deterministically.
4. When a surviving mutant reveals a test gap, write a test that fails against the mutant — same RED-GREEN discipline as TDD.
5. Equivalent mutants are noise. Classify and exclude them; do not chase 100%.
6. Avoid identity values in test inputs (0 for +/-, 1 for \*///, empty string for concat) — they mask operator mutations.
7. Assert on specific values and shapes, not just truthiness.
8. If the mutation tool is slow, suggest configuration improvements (incremental analysis, history, per-test coverage analysis) rather than skipping the tool.

## Integration

- **[Test-Driven Development](../test-driven-development/SKILL.md)** — run mutation testing after TDD cycles to verify test strength
- **[Legacy Code](../legacy-code/SKILL.md)** — after writing characterization tests, use mutation testing to verify those tests catch behavioral changes
- **[Quality Gate Pipeline](../quality-gate-pipeline/SKILL.md)** — mutation score feeds Phase 1 confidence assessment; surviving mutants in reviewed code indicate review gaps
- **[Governance & Compliance](../governance-compliance/SKILL.md)** — mutation score thresholds as quality gates in compliance-sensitive modules
