# Static Analysis Integration

## Overview

This skill defines the static analysis pre-pass for `/code-review`. When
enabled, it runs deterministic analysis tools before AI agents, collecting
structured findings that agents receive as pre-confirmed context. This
reduces token waste on syntactic issues and lets agents focus on semantic
and architectural concerns.

## Constraints

1. **Do not modify code.** Collect and report findings only.
2. **Graceful degradation.** If no tools are installed, return an empty
   result — never fail the pipeline.
3. **Deduplicate across tools.** The same issue reported by both ESLint
   and Semgrep should appear once, attributed to the first tool that
   found it.

## Supported Tools

| Tool       | Detection                                                              | Output Format                 | File Types       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Semgrep    | `which semgrep`                                                        | JSON (`--json`)               | All supported    |
| ESLint     | `npx eslint --version` or project has `.eslintrc*` / `eslint.config.*` | JSON (`-f json`)              | JS, TS, JSX, TSX |
| TypeScript | `tsconfig.json` exists                                                 | Line-based (`tsc --noEmit`)   | TS, TSX          |
| pylint     | `which pylint`                                                         | JSON (`--output-format=json`) | Python           |

## Execution Steps

### 1. Detect available tools

For each tool in the table above, run the detection command. Record
which tools are available. If none are available, return:

```json
{
  "status": "skip",
  "tools": [],
  "findings": [],
  "summary": "No static analysis tools detected — skipping pre-pass."
}
```

### 2. Run each available tool

Run tools in parallel where possible. For each tool:

- **Semgrep**: `semgrep scan --config auto --quiet --json <targets>`
- **ESLint**: `npx eslint -f json <target-js-ts-files>`
- **TypeScript**: `npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1`
- **pylint**: `pylint --output-format=json <target-py-files>`

Map each tool's output to the unified finding schema. See
`references/tool-configs.md` for commands, field mappings, severity
mappings, and JSON schemas per tool.

### 3. Deduplicate findings

Two findings are duplicates if they share the same `file`, `line`, and
a matching `message` (fuzzy — same semantic meaning). When duplicates
exist, keep the finding from the more specific tool (Semgrep > ESLint >
tsc > pylint) and note the duplicate source.

### 4. Return structured result

```json
{
  "status": "pass|warn|fail",
  "tools": ["semgrep", "eslint"],
  "findings": [
    {
      "tool": "semgrep",
      "severity": "error",
      "file": "src/api/handler.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "ruleId": "javascript.express.security.audit.xss",
      "message": "Potential XSS vulnerability",
      "cwe": "CWE-79"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "12 findings from 2 tools: 3 errors, 7 warnings, 2 suggestions"
}
```

Status: `fail` if any errors, `warn` if warnings but no errors,
`pass` if clean or no tools available.

## Agent Context Injection

When findings are passed to review agents, format them as:

```text
## Static Analysis Pre-Pass Results

The following issues were detected by static analysis tools (Semgrep,
ESLint, etc.). These are confirmed syntactic/structural findings.
Do not re-report these issues. Focus your review on semantic and
architectural concerns that static analysis cannot detect.

| Tool | Severity | File | Line | Rule | Message |
|------|----------|------|------|------|---------|
| semgrep | error | src/api/handler.ts | 42 | xss-audit | Potential XSS |
| eslint | warning | src/utils/parse.ts | 17 | no-unused-vars | 'x' is unused |
```

If no findings exist, pass: "Static analysis pre-pass ran (tools:
semgrep, eslint). No findings — all clear."

This context goes to **all** review agents, not just security-review.
Agents in any domain (structure, naming, performance) benefit from
knowing what static tools already caught.
